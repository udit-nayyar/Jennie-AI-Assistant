# TEST-REPO
Jennie is a personal Ai assistant created by Udit Nayyar using different python modules which is based on concept of Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning. Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have your own A.I. assistant? Imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command.
